# city_weather_data

I've created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library [citipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
